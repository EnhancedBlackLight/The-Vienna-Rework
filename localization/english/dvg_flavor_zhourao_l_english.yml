 je_one_kongsi: "One Kongsi!"
 je_one_kongsi_reason: "The Country, Long Divided, Must Unite. Tensions between Mianjin and Yaluo have grown great, and mediation between the two has resulted in failure. The time has come for war, and of this war there may be no winners, for brother will be against brother, and family against family oncemore."
 je_yaluo_reform: "Anger of Conservative Hui"
 je_yaluo_reform_reason: "The turn to democracy in Yaluo, away from the tyrannical oligarchy of Mianjin, might have been expected to be received universally well, however, those in the northern hui of Xinxiang are far more close to their relatives in Mianjin. Too much reform could lead them to rejoining Mianjin and breaking free."
 je_yaluo_reform_goal: "Anger of Conservative Hui"
# je_frontier_wars: "The Frontier Wars"
# je_frontier_wars_reason: "Our recent renegation of our promises with the Hongshan tribes has led to those that were previously working with us turning against us. They have begun actively resisting our rule in the west, and are seeking the complete removal of our influence from the area!"
 
 #Events
 dvg_zhourao.1.t: "The Yaluo League"
 dvg_zhourao.1.d: "Yaluo is the youngest Zhourao state, with a recent origin after the First Kongsi war, wherein Yaluo fought for its independence and won. This has led to a relative period of peace in Zhourao, with the various powers interested in the area mostly agreeing to stay away from the continent. However, growing tensions between Mianjin and Yaluo might very well break the peace in the coming decade."
 dvg_zhourao.1.f: ""The key to success is action, and in action, it is necessary to persevere""
 dvg_zhourao.1.a: "With the help of our Hongshan allies, we can ensure our continued freedom"
 dvg_zhourao.2.t: "The Zongting"
 dvg_zhourao.2.d: "The Zongting, or Assembly Hall, is the parliament body of Yaluo. It is made up of delegates from our constituent Hui, whose members are mostly descended from original colonists from Qingqiu. They are unelected, and in recent times, the issue of membership lists in the Hui has come into debate. There are those who would open up the memberships greatly, even including some Hongshan amongst the lists, and others who would give membership only to those who fought for our independence."
 dvg_zhourao.2.f: "Qingqiu originally colonized the area that would become Zhourao, but the population of Qingqiu settlers was quickly outgrown by Chinese immigration."
 dvg_zhourao.2.a: "Maintain the status quo"
 dvg_zhourao.2.b: "Give membership to those who fought alongside us!"
 dvg_zhourao.2.l: "Open the membership lists"
 dvg_zhourao.3.t: "Koori Tribute"
 dvg_zhourao.3.d: "After our independence war against Mianjin, many of the Guli tribes under our rule have been requesting we grant them a larger share of the gold profits from our mines. We had promised them this in exchange for their help in our war, but now many of the Huis in the north east have been refusing to pay them the promised tribute."
 dvg_zhourao.3.f: "The Hongshan are still reviled as Hongshanman in our northern provinces"
 dvg_zhourao.3.a: "We owe nothing to these barbarians, prepare to crush them!"
 dvg_zhourao.3.b: "We can pay them a part of our treasury to appease both sides."
 dvg_zhourao.3.l: "We will force the northern Hui to pay tribute!"
 dvg_zhourao.4.t: "Scandinavia Wants to Operate Businesses in Yaluo"
 dvg_zhourao.4.d: "Scandinavian businessmen want to be allowed to operate inside of our territory. This would no doubt bring us some measure of wealth, as well as a benefit to our research. However, it would also enrage the more conservative Hui in our nation, who worry that this is merely a prelude to an outright invaision by Scandinavia."
 dvg_zhourao.4.f: "We should not provide the enemy an opportunity to defeat us"
 dvg_zhourao.4.a: "We will have no intervention by the West in Zhourao!"
 dvg_zhourao.4.b: "We will allow them a presence in our ports, nothing more."
 dvg_zhourao.4.c: "We are open to investment!"
 dvg_zhourao.5.t: "One Kongsi"
 dvg_zhourao.5.d: "The time has come in Zhourao, the reforms of Yaluo in recent years have put them on a different course from Mianjin, and as the two Kongsi expand west, tensions are on the rise. A second Kongsi war is on the cards."
 dvg_zhourao.5.f: ""War is politics with bloodshed""
 dvg_zhourao.5.a: "The truce is almost over, soon, we can take the war to our enemy. They however, could too take the war to us."
 dvg_zhourao.6.t: "The Northern Hui Defect!"
 dvg_zhourao.6.d: "Dissatisfied with the reforms implemented by the Zongting, the more conservative Huis in the north have defected back to Mianjin!"
 dvg_zhourao.6.f: "A new beginning often is disguised as a painful ending"
 dvg_zhourao.6.a: "Oh dear"
 dvg_zhourao.7.t: "Militia Mobilize!"
 dvg_zhourao.7.d: "Our reforms might have upset the north, but the south has been galvanized to defend the league and protect our democracy! We are hearing reports of various militias and Guli tribes organizing to defend Yaluo!"
 dvg_zhourao.7.f: ""The people alone are the motive force behind history""
 dvg_zhourao.7.a: "For Yaluo!"
 dvg_zhourao.8.t: "Tensions in the North Ease Over"
 dvg_zhourao.8.d: "With the scope of our reforms not distancing ourselves too far from Mianjin, the conservative Huis have for the most part fallen in line"
 dvg_zhourao.8.f: "A good situation"
 dvg_zhourao.8.a: "A good sign, we can focus on the war with Mianjin"
 dvg_zhourao.9.t: "Yaluo Petitions us for our Annexation!"
 dvg_zhourao.9.d: "We have long had a beneficial relationship with Yaluo, the time has come that Yaluo is asking us to unify."
 dvg_zhourao.9.f: "As it should be."
 dvg_zhourao.9.a: "We refuse! We will make war on them instead!"
 dvg_zhourao.9.b: "We will join our brothers!"
 dvg_zhourao.10.t: "One Kongsi in Zhourao"
 dvg_zhourao.10.d: "With the unification of Mianjin and Yaluo, the time for a unified and strong Zhourao has come. We should look next to our north, and attack the Red Sultans, and bring the Zhouraohui under our dominion, as they have so often tried to bring us under theirs."
 dvg_zhourao.10.f: "Unification, then stability, a nation must be formed of a heap of loose sand."
 dvg_zhourao.10.a: "This day will be remembered!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.t: "The Guli Accept!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.d: "The Guli confederation has accepted our request to integrate them! This is a glorious day for Yaluo, as our nation stretches now across all of the Yongding!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.f: "The Hongshan are an integral part of our nation."
 dvg_zhourao.11.a: "We will annex them right away"
 dvg_zhourao.12.t: "The Second Kongsi War"
 dvg_zhourao.12.d: "The First Kongsi war, fought between Yaluo and Mianjin, is still bitterly remembered in much of the older populace of our nation. It is now time for a second Kongsi war, this time, one that will be final."
 dvg_zhourao.12.f: "We can only end the conflict by winning."
 dvg_zhourao.12.a: "War is the only option now."
 dvg_zhourao.13.t: "The Second Kongsi War"
 dvg_zhourao.13.d: "The First Kongsi war, fought between Yaluo and Mianjin, is still bitterly remembered in much of the older populace of our nation. It is now time for a second Kongsi war, this time, one that will be final."
 dvg_zhourao.13.f: "We can only end the conflict by winning."
 dvg_zhourao.13.a: "War is the only option now."
 dvg_zhourao.501.t: "The Wiradjuri Conflict"
 dvg_zhourao.501.d: "With Europeans ever encroaching towards our land, we will ensure there is plenty of desert in between us and the Europeans. We shall demand the Hongshan tribes of our west bend the knee!"
 dvg_zhourao.501.f: "Hongshanman, or red barbarians from the mountains, is the name the Chinese settlers gave to the aboriginal tribes in the continent after initial contact. Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan."
 dvg_zhourao.501.a: "Onwards!"
 dvg_zhourao.502.t: "Remain Catholic?"
 dvg_zhourao.502.d: "Whilst the elite of our country are still Catholic, recent movements in the Zongting have led to our religion being called into question. Without reform, we might end up in a situation where we face a revolt from the non-catholic Zhourao."
 dvg_zhourao.502.f: "God is with us, but we must honor our roots as well."
 dvg_zhourao.502.a: "Catholicism is the way forward, under god."
 dvg_zhourao.502.b: "We should return to more traditional religion."
 dvg_zhourao.701.t: "The Southern Push"
 dvg_zhourao.701.d: "With the growth of European colonies in Zhourao, it has become a necessity to have a properly defined border. We have met with the Europeans, and agreed on a suitable border. Now it is only necessary to demand the tribes of the Hongshanman bend the knee to us."
 dvg_zhourao.701.f: "Hongshanman, or red barbarians from the mountains, is the name the Chinese settlers gave to the aboriginal tribes in the continent after initial contact. Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan."
 dvg_zhourao.701.a: "It is our natural right."
 
 dvg_carlshavn.1.t: "Asking for Scandinavian Assistance"
 dvg_carlshavn.1.d: "Even with our decision to ask Scandinavia, many wonder"
 dvg_carlshavn.1.f: "PLACEHOLDER(did not use this event after all, so it is just all here to avoid errors, might delete event later)"
 dvg_carlshavn.1.a: "PLACEHOLDER(did not use this event after all, so it is just all here to avoid errors, might delete event later)"
 dvg_carlshavn.1.b: "PLACEHOLDER(did not use this event after all, so it is just all here to avoid errors, might delete event later)"
 dvg_carlshavn.2.t: "Yaluo Asks for Aid"
 dvg_carlshavn.2.d: "Whilst we were the ones approaching Yaluo for trade earlier, they now have approached us for aid in turn. Their northernly neighbor, Mianjin, is threatening war. It is an excellent opportunity to extract more out of our relationship with Yaluo."
 dvg_carlshavn.2.f: ""Trust is earned by many deeds, and lost by only one""
 dvg_carlshavn.2.a: "They are on their own"
 dvg_carlshavn.2.l: "We should take advantage of the chaos in Xinxiang to propose they become our protectorate!"
 dvg_carlshavn.2.g: "We will give them guns in exchange for rights to the Yongjia Gulf"
 #dvg_carlshavn.2.e: "We will blockade Mianjin for the Yongjia"
 #dvg_carlshavn.2.b: "We can push for even more, let us make something out of this!"
 dvg_carlshavn.3.t: "Scandinavia Refuses!"
 dvg_carlshavn.3.d: "Scandinavia has refused our request for aid! Whilst this is disheartening, many among our people are breathing a sigh of relief at the news."
 dvg_carlshavn.3.f: "Then we are on our own"
 dvg_carlshavn.3.a: "At least we have avoided the Scandinavian wolf for now"
 dvg_carlshavn.40.t: "Scandinavia Offers us 'Protection'"
 dvg_carlshavn.40.d: "An insulting offer from Scandinavia has just reached us, they are demanding we submit to their rule in exchange for their protection. Whilst this would save us from being defeated by Mianjin, it would subordinate our nation forever to Scandinavia."
 dvg_carlshavn.40.f: "Protection, but at what cost?"
 dvg_carlshavn.40.a: "Outrageous!"
 dvg_carlshavn.40.b: "We have no choice..."
 dvg_carlshavn.41.t: "Yaluo Refuses Our Offer"
 dvg_carlshavn.41.d: "Yaluo, perhaps expectedly, has declined our offer to have them submit to the Scandinavian crown."
 dvg_carlshavn.41.f: ""Next time we ask, we will not be asking.""
 dvg_carlshavn.41.a: "We will not forget this insult."
 dvg_carlshavn.42.t: "Yaluo Accepts Our Offer!"
 dvg_carlshavn.42.d: "Yaluo has accepted our offer of protection! This will mean great things for our interests in the region."
 dvg_carlshavn.42.f: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
 dvg_carlshavn.42.a: "They have recognized the benefits of submission to our glorious empire!"
 dvg_carlshavn.50.t: "Scandinavia Offers us Arms!"
 dvg_carlshavn.50.d: "Scandinavia has offered us weapons in exchange for the Yongjia gulf,
 dvg_carlshavn.50.f: ""Weapons are important, but it is men and materials that will win the war""
 dvg_carlshavn.50.a: "We accept their offer, the benefits will be worth the claim to a portion of land we do not even own yet!"
 dvg_carlshavn.50.b: "We should see if we can simply buy the guns instead."
 dvg_carlshavn.50.l: "We refuse, we will not be giving the Scandinavians anything for such worthless aid!"
 dvg_carlshavn.51.t: "Yaluo Refuses Our Aid!
 dvg_carlshavn.51.d: "Yaluo has declined our aid, our advisors warn that asking for complete rights to Yongjia might have been to far for the Yaluo. It is a grave insult that we shall not easily forget."
 dvg_carlshavn.51.f: "Were they expecting charity?"
 dvg_carlshavn.51.a: "They asked for aid though?"
 dvg_carlshavn.52.t: "Yaluo Accepts our Aid!"
 dvg_carlshavn.52.d: "We can now begin the process of supplying Yaluo with arms for the duration of their war, we will send the older models, they will not know the difference, and they are better than theirs either way."
 dvg_carlshavn.52.f: "Guns for land, it matters not to us who fires them"
 dvg_carlshavn.52.a: "Yongjia will soon be ours, we just need to subjugate the native tribes first"
 dvg_carlshavn.53.t: "Yaluo Proposes a Counter Offer"
 dvg_carlshavn.53.d: "The delegate from Yaluo has offered to buy our guns instead of offering us the Yongjia. This is not ideal, however we can still utilize this to enrich our coffers."
 dvg_carlshavn.53.f: "It is not the Yongjia, but we can take that later should we desire."
 dvg_carlshavn.53.a: "No deal, we are not in the business of negotiating with our inferiors."
 dvg_carlshavn.53.b: "It is still acceptable, even if it is not ideal."
 dvg_carlshavn.54.t: "Scandinavia Refuses Our Offer!"
 dvg_carlshavn.54.d: "We seem to have been reaching too much in offering the Scandinavians a counter offer, their delegation has left enraged by our refusal to grant them rights to the Yongjia. Some worry that this might lead to the Scandinavians descending upon our country in the future..."
 dvg_carlshavn.54.f: ""Profits are short-term benefits, righteousness is a long-term benefit. They are not in opposition.""
 dvg_carlshavn.54.a: "Unfortunate"
 dvg_carlshavn.55.t: "Scandinavia Accepts Our Offer!"
 dvg_carlshavn.55.d: "We have managed to get guns from Scandinavia without giving them the Yongjia, this is truely a good day!"
 dvg_carlshavn.55.f: ""Profits are short-term benefits, righteousness is a long-term benefit. They are not in opposition.""
 dvg_carlshavn.55.a: "A small price to pay for salvation"
