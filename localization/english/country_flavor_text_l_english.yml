 BRG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Burgundy once swore fealty to the Kings of France, but its entertaining of independence was always there. Phillip of Burgundy stopped the entertaining of the notion, and put it into action while carving out a great swathe of land and eventually created the crown and title Rex Burgundicum through force of will and arms. Today Burgundy is much the same, grown slightly to include greater amounts of the Dual Monarchies' land and slight increases in German lands under its direct control.

Founded by Christian merchants from Qingqiu, it developed tremendously in the XVIIIth century with the arrival of thousands of Chinese settlers who fled the endemic wars in China. The Republic has withstood assaults from the Red Sultans in the North and established several contacts with the Maori tribes and secured the naval roads to Qingqiu while growing more and more into a proper Little China. However, the rule of the patrician families which hold all the power in the state has provoked a miner's rebellion in the South, leading to the loss of several great towns and mines to the recent League of Yaluo. Mianjin now stands at a crossroad : can they emulate their brethern in Qingqiu to embrace modernity and unite the Zhourao states? Or should the rule of the rich continue without any reform?"

However, all the attempts of the Red Sultans to conquer their southern neighbours have been unsuccessful and the court in Butingshan has grown decadent and increasingly reliant on the Dual-Monarchy, always eager to expand their markets.
