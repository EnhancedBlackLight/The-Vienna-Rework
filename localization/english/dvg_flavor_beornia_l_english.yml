 je_conquest_new_cornwall: "Conquest of the Southern Deserts"
 je_conquest_new_cornwall_reason: "The Kingdom of Beornia's southern border was marked by the river Graham after a treaty with the Mapuche Tribes whom resisted our earlier attempts at settling these lands. The Incans have laid bare their own ambitions to seize the Amerigan Cone so it has become a necessity for us to seize the southern deserts in the name of the crown before they or anyone else does."
