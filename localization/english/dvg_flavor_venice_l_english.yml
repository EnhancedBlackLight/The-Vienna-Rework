 je_venice_and_greece:0 "A Crisis Brewing in Greece"
 je_venice_and_greece_reason:0 "The Venetian intervention in favor of the Greek Rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman Civil War was crucial in ending Ottoman rule over the Balkans. However, while the support of Venice was crucial in saving the fledging rebellion, the subsequent annexation of Greece by Venice has deeply outraged Greek nationalists and caused unrest throughout mainland Greece. The status quo cannot hold and the promise of Doge Silvestro Dandolo to re-evaluate Greece's relationship with Venice after the war's completion is quickly coming due."

venice.1.t:0 "The History and Present Situation of Venice"
venice.1.d:0 "The Republic of Venice stands on the crossroads of the Mediterranean. Queen of the Adriatic, Venice's power, wealth, and status have greatly diminished since its heights during the Renaissance. Though still in possession of a vast colonial empire stretching from Cyprus to Athesia, the recent intervention in the Ottoman Civil War and acquisition of the Greek mainland has become an evergrowing headache. Greek nationalists increasingly call for a fully independent Greece, while to the West, nationalistic forces are plotting to unify Italy, once and for all. Yet in the face of these threats, the Patrician nobility continues to resist the winds of change, fearful that any change to the status quo will end their vicelike grip over power. As a Doge, you will have to guide Venice during this perilous century or watch as Venice fades into ever greater irrelevance."

#Now the call for Greek independence can be heard far and wide throughout the Greek possessions, while to the West, nationalistic forces are plotting to unify Italy, once and for all. Yet in the face of these threats, the Patrician nobility continues to resist the winds of change, fearful that any change to the status quo will end their vicelike grip over power. As a Doge, you will have to guide Venice during this perilous century or watch as Venice fades into ever greater irrelevance.

#Interest Group Descriptions
ig_barnabotti:0 "Barnabotti"
ig_barnabotti_desc:0 "A particular class of patricians whose families, though having fallen on hard financial times, still held the right to vote in the Great Council. The Bernabotti defacto represent the voice of the poor, though this voice is rarely heard as the Bernabotti are far more concerned with the selling of their votes so as to regain their former status. Interestingly, the term Barnabotti comes from the zone that many of these families lived and congregated, Campo San Barnaba, which was distant from the city center and thus cheaper to rent."

Though initially a rare occurance (only three opening ever occured between the 17th and 18th Century), as the economic importance of the Mediterian continues to decline, the Venitian state has increasingly found itself forced to open the noble body to new families who are willing to pay."
