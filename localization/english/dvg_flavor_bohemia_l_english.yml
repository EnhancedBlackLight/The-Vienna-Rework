 je_elbian_confederation: "Elbian Confederation"
 je_elbian_confederation_reason: "While our attempts at reforming the Holy Roman Empire might have failed, we can still seek to use our special relationship with the Elbian princes to seek a lesser confederation."
 elbian_confederation_invalid: "Bohemia or its subjects own no Elbian homeland states"
 elbian_confederation_tt: "Country will become known as the Elbian Confederation"
 je_hre_external: "Centralizing the Empire's Borders"
 je_hre_internal: "Centralizing Bohemia?"
 hre_tt: "Country will become known as the Holy Roman Empire"
 je_hre_external_reason: "The Holy Roman Empire is a frail concept, its enforcement should be our first duty! A unified Holy Roman Empire is no easy task, and will require the ownership of all the states of the Empire."
 je_hre_internal_reason: "The Holy Roman Empire has never been unified and it will require a strong leader able to steer the state through any turbulent times. Reforms are required in order to bring about a centralized authority, with faith inbued into the Kaiser."
