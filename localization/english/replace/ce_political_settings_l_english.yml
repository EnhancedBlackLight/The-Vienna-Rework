 ce_debate_events.27.d:0 "Our efforts to pass the [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] law have run into several classic bureaucratic hurdles. Debates rage around such lofty matters as the correct shape of filing cabinets."
 ce_debate_events.27.f:1 ""Good, fast, cheap. You get two.""
 ce_debate_events.27.a:0 "We will spare no expense."

 ce_debate_events.28.d:0 "An assassin's bullet narrowly missed a minister from the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('assassination_target_ig').GetName] this morning, prompting calls for the rapid passage of [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] laws. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('they_dont_like_laws_ig').GetName], opponents of [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName], are also being accused of implicitly supporting the assassin."
 ce_debate_events.28.f:0 ""This near-miss is just the latest in a long line of incidents. If we don't do something today, then when? How many have to be hurt before we take action?""
 ce_debate_events.28.a:0 "We must protect our own."

 ce_debate_events.29.d:0 "The national effort to implement [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] has become the subject of debate between partisan newspapers, and may disrupt the lawmaking process."
 ce_debate_events.29.f:0 ""Dear editor,\n\nAs a private citizen definitely not connected with the ongoing national dispute over this law enforcement legislation, I, someone who is absolutely only a private citizen, have a few choice words I wish to write...""
 ce_debate_events.29.a:0 "Let the newspapers say what they want."
 ce_debate_events.29.b:0 "Issue our own editorials for the papers."

 ce_debate_events.30.t:0 "The Rally Run Roughshod"
 ce_debate_events.30.d:0 "A largely peaceful demonstration for [SCOPE.sPoliticalMovement('rally_movement').GetName] has been violently broken up by the local militia. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('rally_movement_ig').GetName], a major supporter of the movement, is particularly upset by the violence. The incident has led many to question the wisdom in establishing any permanent law enforcement with the right to use force."
 ce_debate_events.30.f:0 ""The wicked, the butchers, have drawn their axes that already reek with the blood of the innocent. Is this the 'justice' you seek to spread across the nation? Unless the government calls its ministers to account and relieves the people, it will surely be deposed.""
 ce_debate_events.30.a:0 "Perhaps a period of reflection is necessary right now."
 ce_debate_events.30.b:0 "We can't let word of this get out- crack down on the movement to [SCOPE.sPoliticalMovement('rally_movement').GetName]."

 ce_debate_events.34.d:0 "A protest advocating for the [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] law was called in order to silence the detractors. However, the police force decided to take the law in their own hands and violently repressed the protestors."
 ce_debate_events.34.f:1 ""Ah! The irony of the situation! A protest against our current laws that fail to protect the citizen from the corrupted police is shut down by said police! My hands tremble with a feeling of indignation while I write this article. If the police are capable of this now, what else will they do in the future? We need the law to protect us.""
 ce_debate_events.34.a:0 "Both parties need to calm down."

 ce_debate_events.37.f:0 ""There are certainly differences between acedemic discussions and real world legislation, especially in implementing a whole system of law. Nevertheless, as architects of the upper floors of this towering structure of knowledge, we believe the least we can do is provide some insight into how the foundation should be built.""

 ce_debate_events.38.f:0 ""This is not merely about keeping an orderly classroom so that knowledge can be imparted; it is about imparting character. After all, we have been given an enormous responsibility by the parents of these children, who do all they can to raise them as upstanding citizens. Too often, we find boys joining the military service whose character has already been almost irrevocably ruined by an unruly youth and a lack of respect for authority. It needn't be so!""

 ce_debate_events.39.d:0 "There is some disagreement within the government over how the provisions of the civil law in [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] should shape the future of the country and its people. In particular, discussions on issues such as marriage, commercial law, and juvenile delinquency were extremely intense. Some believing that we shall be progressive as much as possible, so the future generations don't have to do this all over again. Whilst some others accuse those are thoughts of book-worms, throwing irresponsible social experiments at the people. "
 
 ce_debate_events.39.f:0 ""These laws, policies and acts may have been well suited our country two centuries ago, or some other extraordinary socities on the other side of the globe, but to believe that they can guide our society in modern era is simply madness!
